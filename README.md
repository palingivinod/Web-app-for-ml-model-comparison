# 🌐 Web App for ML Model Comparison

An interactive **Streamlit web application** for comparing machine learning models on the Titanic dataset.
This project demonstrates the entire ML workflow — from data preprocessing to hyperparameter tuning — in an engaging, visual way.

---

## ✨ Features

* 🔧 **Live Hyperparameter Tuning**
  Adjust parameters (e.g., `C` for SVM, max depth for Random Forest) and instantly see how they affect accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

* 🤝 **Model Comparison**
  Evaluate and compare:

  * 📈 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * 📊 Logistic Regression
  * 🌳 Random Forest

* 📊 **Interactive Visualizations**

  * Confusion Matrix
  * ROC Curve
  * Precision–Recall Curve

* 💻 **Full-Stack Data Science**
  Built with Python and Streamlit — bridging ML, data science, and web development.
